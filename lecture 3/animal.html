                Cattle slaughter, especially cow slaughter is a controversial topic in India because of the cattle's traditional status as an endeared and respected living being to many Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists while being considered an acceptable source of meat by Muslims as well as adherents of some other Indian religions.
                 More specifically, the cow's slaughter has been shunned because of a number of reasons such as being associated with god Krishna in Hinduism, cattle being respected as an integral part of rural livelihoods and an essential economic necessity.
                  Cattle slaughter has also been opposed by various Indian religions because of the ethical principle of Ahimsa (non-violence) and the belief in the unity of all life Legislation against cattle slaughter is in place throughout most states of India except Kerala, Goa, West Bengal, and states of the North-East.[16]

                Article 48 of the Constitution of India mandates the state to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle.
                 On 26 October 2005, the Supreme Court of India, in a landmark judgement upheld the constitutional validity of anti-cow slaughter laws enacted by different state governments in India.
                  20 out of 29 states in India currently have various laws regulating act of slaughtered cow, prohibiting the slaughter or sale of cows.
                   Kerala, Goa, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura are the states where there are no restrictions on cow slaughter.
                    As per existing meat export policy in India, the export of beef (meat of cow, oxen and calf) is prohibited. Bone in meat, carcass, half carcass of buffalo is also prohibited and is not permitted to be exported.
                     Only the boneless meat of buffalo, meat of goat and sheep and birds are permitted for export. India feels that the restriction on export to only boneless meat with a ban on meat with bones will add to the brand image of Indian meat. Animal carcasses are subjected to maturation for at least 24 hours before deboning.
                 Subsequent heat processing during the bone removal operation is believed to be sufficient to kill the Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus
